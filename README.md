# Jura S8 Recipes
My personal collection of coffee recipes modified for a Jura espresso machine - specifically the Jura S8
--

Notes:
- New users may be confused on the milk dispensing system (using time vs volume).  Take note of the Cortado and Cortadito recipes.  They require “equal amounts of milk” to the coffee.  I brewed these drinks with a scale under the cup and stopped the milk function when the amount of needed grams of milk was reached.  For Whole Milk, 15 seconds is about 3 ounces, 12 seconds is about 2 ounces and 6 seconds is about 1 ounce.
- My grind setting: 3rd position from finest grind
- Bean settings (aroma profile).  There are 5 bean icons, each with half steps, allowing for 10 levels of aroma profile (which just alters how much coffee is ground).  If I say "Bean: 3", I mean there are 3 whole icons of beans filled in, which is actually "Level 6".  Similarly, "Bean 4.5" would mean 9 half-bean icons are filled in (just shy of the max setting).
- I'm opting to use 1oz volumes for espresso and 2oz for doppio.  I believe those are correct/traditional volumes, but coming from a Nespresso, I was used to shots that are 1.5 oz; and the Jura default is also 1.5 oz.
- Milk times are with whole milk with the exception of the Cafe Latte which I use oat milk

Coffees

**Espresso (1oz):**
... Bean:  4
... Volume: 1 oz

**Doppio (2oz):**
I originally used the “Double Product” feature on an espresso.  While it yielded a 2oz drink, I was not sure what was happening in the background.  I expected grind, pour, grind, pour.  I think it just ground a little more coffee.  Also, my Doppio just wasted a space on the main screen.  If you really want a doppio, just do this for your recipes:
... Bean:  5 (max)
... Volume: 2 oz

**Americano (6.5oz drink)**
... Espresso
... 5.5 oz hot water

**Latte Macchiato (7.5 oz)** 
This is the default recipe from the machine

... Interval: 30 Seconds

**Cafe Cubano (1oz)**
A sweet drink consisting of whipped sugar and strong espresso.  Whipped sugar rises to the top. 
Prep: when making the espresso, slide the bean to level 5 (maximum) and make the espresso in a cup not being used to serve.
… Bean: 5
... 1 espresso (in a temporary cup - e.g. paper cup)

Directions: In your serving glass/cup: Mix 1 tsp of espresso with the sugar and whip for 2-3 mins.  Pour remaining coffee in cup and mix again.
