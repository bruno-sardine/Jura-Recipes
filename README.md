# Jura S8 Recipes
My personal collection of coffee recipes modified for a Jura espresso machine - specifically the Jura S8

Notes:
- New users may be confused on the milk dispensing system (using time vs volume).  Take note of the Cortado and Cortadito recipes.  They require “equal amounts of milk” to the coffee.  I brewed these drinks with a scale under the cup and stopped the milk function when the amount of needed grams of milk was reached.  In general, for "Milk Foam", it's 6 secs (1oz), 11 sec (2oz), and 16 sec (3 oz).  "BUT ThAt'Z nOt HoW IT WorKZzzzzzz!!!!!  YOu'RE DoINg it WroNG ANd giVInG bAd AdviCE!!!". Listen - I think you're supposed to brew your shot, manually add "Milk Foam", and just hit the CANCEL button when the amount of milk looks about right or tastes right.  If you paid attention, you realize "I cancelled the milk after about 5 seconds". Now you can SAVE your recipe with "5 seconds of milk".  It's really the same thing I did, except I used a scale.
- My current grind setting: 1st position (finest grind)
- Coffee Strength (aroma profile).  There are 5 bean icons, each with half steps, allowing for 10 levels of aroma profile (which just alters how much coffee is ground).  Referring to the image, if I say "Bean: .5", I mean there is a single half-icon of beans filled in.  Similarly, "Bean 3" would mean 3 full-bean icons are filled in.  Bean 5 would be the max setting.  I only bring this up because J.O.E uses a different strength setting, and I think some of the other Jura machines do too.

- I'm opting to use 1oz volumes for espresso and 2oz for doppio.  I believe those are correct/traditional volumes, but coming from a Nespresso, I was used to shots that are 1.5 oz; and the Jura default is also 1.5 oz.
- Milk times are with whole milk with the exception of the Cafe Latte which I use oat milk

###### Interesting Info
- At finest grind setting + Bean 4, 1oz espresso extraction time is 9.2 seconds.  At grind setting 3, extraction was 7.6 seconds.  Bean 5 might make it go to 10 seconds.  Also note my 1oz size, NOT the default 1.5oz size which would certainly give you a 10-11 second extraction.  I'm cool with 9.2 seconds.
- 25g of water used to clean the coffee spout
- "Hot Water" and "Hot Water for Tea": 175 degrees.  I'm not sure why there are 2 product settings for this.

## **Espresso (1oz):**

```
Bean: 4
Volume: 1 oz
```

## **Doppio (2 oz):**
###### Notes:
I originally used the “Double Product” feature on an espresso.  While it yielded a 2oz drink, I was not sure what was happening in the background.  I expected grind, pour, grind, pour.  I think it just ground a little more coffee.  Also, my Doppio just wasted a space on the main screen.  If you really want a doppio, just do this for your recipes:

```
Bean: 5 (max)
Volume: 2 oz
```

## **Americano (6.5 oz)**

```
Espresso
5.5 oz hot water
```

## **Latte Macchiato (7.5 oz)**

This is the default recipe from the machine

```
Bean: 4
Volume: 3oz
Milk: 22 Seconds
Interval: 30 Seconds
```

## **Cafe Cubano (1oz)**
###### Notes:
A sweet drink consisting of whipped sugar and strong espresso.  Whipped sugar rises to the top. 
###### Prep:
When making the espresso, slide the bean to level 5 (maximum) and make the espresso in a cup not being used to serve.

```
Espresso (brewed in a temporary cup - e.g. paper cup)
2 tsp sugar
```

###### Directions: 
In your serving glass/cup: Mix 1 tsp of espresso with the sugar and whip for 2-3 mins.  Pour remaining coffee in cup and mix again.
