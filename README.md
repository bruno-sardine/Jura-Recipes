###### Notes:
- New users may be confused on the milk dispensing system (using time vs volume).  Take note of the Cortado and Cortadito recipes.  They require “equal amounts of milk” to the coffee.  I brewed these drinks with a scale under the cup and stopped the milk function when the amount of needed grams of milk was reached.  In general, for "Milk Foam", it's 6 secs (1oz), 11 sec (2oz), and 16 sec (3 oz).  "BUT ThAt'Z nOt HoW IT WorKZzzzzzz!!!!!  YOu'RE DoINg it WroNG ANd giVInG bAd AdviCE!!!". Listen - I think you're supposed to brew your shot, manually add "Milk Foam", and just hit the CANCEL button when the amount of milk looks about right or tastes right.  If you paid attention, you realize "I cancelled the milk after about 5 seconds". Now you can SAVE your recipe with "5 seconds of milk".  It's really the same thing I did, except I used a scale.
- Coffee Strength (aroma profile).  There are 5 bean icons, each with half steps, allowing for 10 levels of aroma profile (which just alters how much coffee is ground).  Referring to the image, if I say "Coffee Strength: .5", I mean there is a single half-icon of beans filled in.  Similarly, "Coffee Strength 3" would mean 3 full-bean icons are filled in.  Coffee Strength 5 would be the max setting.  I only bring this up because J.O.E uses a different strength setting, and I think some of the other Jura machines do too.

- I used to use 1oz volumes for espresso and 2oz for doppio.  I believe those are correct/traditional volumes. However, 1 oz espresso was just too bitter from the Jura.  My advice is to stick with the Jura default of 1.5 oz (especially if you're coming from a Nespresso which is the same).
- Milk times are with whole milk with the exception of the Café Latte which I use oat milk

###### Coffee Tasting Notes
If you can dial in the espresso and coffee (drink) for the beans, the rest of the drinks fall into place

|Coffee| Coffee Strength | Volume | Grind | Temp | Coffee (drink) Settings
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Lavazza Super Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend | 3 | 1.5 | 3 | Normal | Strength 2.5 - Vol 4.5 - Temp Low |
| El Salvador El Mural Med. Roast from Atlas Coffee Club | 3.5 | 2 oz | 3 | High | Strength 3.5 - Vol 5 - Temp High |

###### Interesting Info
- What's the difference between (product) and (2 x product)?  Let's talk about espresso.  With my settings, an espresso at 4 coffee strength at 1.5 ounce volume will produce a wet 23g discarded coffee puck.  If you make a "2 x Espresso" at 1.5 volume, you get a 3 ounce pour (makes sense), but the machine still produces a wet 23g discarded coffee puck.  You end up with an over extracted bitter 3oz drink.  But the real idea is that you are supposed to use a cup under each spout to make 2 espressos at once.  Doing so cuts said bitterness in half; it's more tollerable.  But my advice - just make 2 single espressos.  When you find a bean, coffee strength, and volume ratio you like - stick with it.  Make your gests their own shot.  Forget the "2 x" stuff.  I SUPPOSE you could lessen the coffee stregnth on the 2x setting, but really - save a spot on the main product grid for something fun, like a Cortado.
- Extraction times for espresso.  You mostly want to shoot for a 9-12 second extraction time.  Play around with it depending on your beans, grind setting, and Coffee Strength setting.  
- 25g of water used to clean the coffee spout
- "Hot Water" and "Hot Water for Tea": 175 degrees.  I'm not sure why there are 2 product settings for this.

###### Operating Costs
It's All in the Filters

  Sadly, it's extremely difficult for a homeowner to recoup money when buying a Jura and making little to no trips to a coffee house.  Your costs in water filters is what kills you (if you don't make many milk drinks, just buy a big 1000ml bottle of milk cleaner to last you 6 months).  The Clearyl filters cost about $25 each and I go through 1/mo with my filtered "Hardness 2" Florida water ($300/yr).   The filters do not last long, I believe, due to the sheer amount of time the machine rinses itself - and I haven't found a true pattern.  When it turns on - a rinse; when it turns off - possibly a rinse; randomly while it's on - sometimes a rinse; the milk spout - maybe a rinse, or maybe not.  Most of my water usage is maintenance - not making product!  I also make mostly Americanos (7 oz water usage) and Hot Water for Green Tea (8 oz), so filter my usage would be higher than someone only making espressos and macchiatos.  Here is my break-even math:

- Refurb Jura S8 + accessories: $2700
- Trips to Coffee House: $600/yr (that included snacks and food)
- Clearyl Filters: $300/yr
- (Coffee House Trips) - (Filters) = $300 savings per year.
- $2700 / $300 = 9 years for my break-even.

BUT - I need to keep buying filters, right?  So after my break-even period I'm still spending $300 a year on filters.
I break even for exactly 1 day.
My action plan: stick it out for 9 years, hope filter technology is better by then, sell the S8, buy a new Jura and start over.

###### What about J.O.E?
- There are 16 custom spots you can add recipes to in addition to the 12 normal presets (ristretto, flat white, hot water for green tea, etc)
- There seems to be no syncing.  The Cortado on my main product screen does not appear in the J.O.E app.  I would need to recreate it in J.O.E.  This may not be bad because now you have 22 custom spots for recipes (8 on the machine, 16 in the app).  Configure your main 8 for the visual show-off to your guests, and J.O.E for some of the drinks no one would really ask for.
- It's way easier to look at the Jura maintenance in J.O.E, than on the machine, by tapping "Cockpit" in the app.

# Recipes

## **Espresso (1.5 oz):**

```
See: Coffee Tasting Notes
```

## **Doppio (3 oz):**
###### Notes:
I originally used the “Double Product” feature on an espresso.  While it yielded a 3 oz drink, I was not sure what was happening in the background.  I expected grind, pour, grind, pour.  I think it just ground a little more coffee.  Also, my Doppio just wasted a space on the main screen.  If you really want a doppio, just do this for your recipes:

```
Coffee Strength: 5 (max)
Volume: 3 oz
```

## **Americano (7 oz)**

```
Espresso
4.5oz hot water
```

## **Latte Macchiato (7.5 oz)**
###### Notes:
This is the default recipe from the machine

```
Coffee Strength: 4
Volume: 3oz
Milk: 22 Seconds
Interval: 30 Seconds
```

## **Café Cubano (1oz)**
###### Notes:
A sweet drink consisting of whipped sugar and strong espresso.  Whipped sugar rises to the top. 
###### Prep:
When making the espresso, slide the bean to level 5 (maximum) and make the espresso in a cup not being used to serve.

```
Espresso (brewed in a temporary cup - e.g. paper cup)
2 tsp sugar
```

###### Directions: 
In your serving glass/cup: Mix 1 tsp of espresso with the sugar and whip for 2-3 mins.  Pour remaining coffee in cup and mix again.

## **Cortado (4oz)**
###### Notes:
2 shots of espresso (a doppio) with equal amount of steamed milk

```
Coffee Strength: 5
Espresso (2 oz)
Steamed Milk (11 seconds)
```

## **Café Marrón  (4oz)**
###### Notes:
A Venezuelan drink identical to the Cortado, but with a very slightly less amount of milk

```
Coffee Strength: 5
Espresso (2 oz)
Steamed Milk (9 seconds)
```

## **Cortadito (2oz)**
###### Notes:
1 tbsp sugar + 1 shot of espresso brewed over the sugar with equal amount of steamed milk.

```
1 tbsp sugar
1 espresso
  Quickly mix/dissolve the sugar before the milk comes out!
Steamed Milk: 6 seconds
```

## **Flat White**
###### Notes:
This is the default recipe from the machine

```
Coffee Strength: 4
Volume: 2 oz
Steamed Milk: 14 Seconds
```

## **Cappuccino (5.x oz)**
###### Notes:
This is the default recipe from the machine

```
Coffee Strength: 2.5
Steamed Milk: 14 Seconds
Volume: 3oz
```

## **Fauxtail Café Latte (10oz)**
###### Notes:
The 60 seconds milk is SPECIFIC to the milk I use.  This is to my taste, and a close approximation to Foxtail's Oatmilk Latte (except they use their beans, and they use Oatly!  I use Planet Oat for the lower calories).  In general, the correct latte ratio is 1:3; but coffee shops seems to use a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio.  This recipe is about 1:4 (2oz to 8oz). If I were to make a "1:3 normal latte", I would change to a 1:3 ratio (which would be 1.5oz espresso to around 22ish seconds milk).

```
Coffee Strength:  5 (max)
Steamed Oat Milk: 60 Seconds (Planet Oat Unsweetened Original)
Volume: 2 oz
```

## **Fauxtail Cappuccino**
###### Notes: 
Use 1oz Espresso (x2)

```
Coffee Strength:  5 (max)

Brew another shot
Steamed Milk: 15 seconds
```

## **Fauxtail Gingerbread Latte**

```
1/2 oz Gingerbread syrup
1/4 oz Vanilla syrup
Espresso
Volume 1.5 oz
Steamed milk: 60 secs.
```

## **Fauxtail Eggnog Latte**

```
